# Production Boilerplate for Startups

**Community**: [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/8cUHbgAHXH)

## Getting Started

Choose Flutter or NextJS

- [Choose Flutter](./flutter/README.md) if you plan to build or expand into cross-platform apps (e.g. Duolingo, Fitbit, Spotify, Tinder, etc.)
- [Choose NextJS](./nextjs/README.md) if SEO, page load speeds, and web-specific libraries are integral to your app (e.g. Shopify, Medium, etc.)

Additionally, it's also possible to start with one-platform and move onto the next one depending on your needs. For example, start with Next.JS and then move to Flutter when a mobile app is needed. Both are configured to work straight out of the box.
